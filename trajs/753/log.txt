Historically affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), it is a member of the Associated Colleges of the South and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Rhodes enrolls about 2,000 students, and its Collegiate Gothic campus sits on a 123-acre wooded site in Memphis' historic Midtown neighborhood.. The early origins of Rhodes can be traced to the mid-1830s and the establishment of the all-male "Montgomery Academy" on the outskirts of Clarksville, Tennessee.[4] The city's flourishing tobacco market and profitable river port made Clarksville one of the fastest-growing cities in the then-western United States and quickly led to calls to turn the modest "log college" into a proper university.[4] In 1848, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized the conveyance of the academy's property for the establishment of the "Masonic University of Tennessee".[4]. In 1855, control of the university passed to the Presbyterian Church, and it was renamed "Stewart College" in honor of its president and benefactor, William M.
