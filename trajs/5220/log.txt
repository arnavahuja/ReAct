STEP: 2

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 2: The current observation states that Seth MacFarlane graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) where he studied animation. However, it mentions "Larry & Steve" was created "during this time" but in the context of working for Hanna-Barbera, not specifically while *studying*. The question asks about *two* animated short films created *while studying* at a college. The current passage doesn't explicitly state he made two films while studying at RISD. I need to find information linking specific short films to his time as a student.
