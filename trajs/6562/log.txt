STEP: 3

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 3: My previous search for Rønnaug Alten did not provide details about her stage debut, and looking up "debut" yielded no further results in the current passage. The question specifies that she debuted as "Viola" in 1930 at Den Nationale Scene. The character "Viola" is most famously from William Shakespeare's play *Twelfth Night*. I will search for *Twelfth Night* to identify its author.
Action 3: Search[Twelfth Night]
Observation 3: Twelfth Night, or What You Will is a romantic comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601–1602 as a Twelfth Night entertainment for the close of the Christmas season. The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (disguised as a page named 'Cesario') falls in love with the Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her, thinking she is a man.. The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion,[1] with plot elements drawn from Barnabe Rich's short story "Of Apollonius and Silla", based on a story by Matteo Bandello.

SIMULATION TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 3: The previous lookup of "debut" gave me a generic error message. I need to find information about Rønnaug Alten's stage debut, specifically the play where she played "Viola" at Den Nationale Scene in 1930. The Wikipedia page for Rønnaug Alten doesn't seem to have this detail. Given the character name "Viola", it strongly suggests Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night". I will search for "Twelfth Night" and see if Rønnaug Alten is mentioned in connection with it, or if it mentions the character Viola. If not, I can then try searching for "Den Nationale Scene" and look for 1930 productions.
Action 3: Search[Twelfth Night]
Observation 3: **Twelfth Night, or What You Will**. *Twelfth Night, or What You Will* is a romantic comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601–1602 as a Twelfth Night's entertainment for the close of the Christmas season. The play centers on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola, disguised as a young man named Cesario, falls in love with Duke Orsino, whom she serves, while Orsino is in love with Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Cesario, Olivia falls in love with the disguised Viola, creating a classic love triangle..
