        "The Polar Express is a 1985 fantasy children's picture book written and illustrated by American author Chris Van Allsburg. The book is now widely considered to be a classic Christmas story for young children.[a] It was praised for its detailed illustrations and calm, relaxing storyline. For the work, Van Allsburg won the annual Caldecott Medal for illustration of an American children's picture book in 1986, his second after Jumanji.[1][2]. The book is set partially in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the author's home town, and was inspired in part by Van Allsburg's memories of visiting the Herpolsheimer's and Wurzburg's department stores as a child.[3] It was adapted as a motion-capture film in 2004 starring Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis. Van Allsburg served as an executive producer on the film..",

        "The previous searches for \"The Polar Express\" and its presence at Walt Disney World, and general Walt Disney World attractions, have not yielded the answer. \"The Polar Express\" is a 2004 computer-animated Christmas movie, but it's not a Disney IP. This suggests either I'm misunderstanding the question, or the attraction isn't directly named after the movie or is not directly part of the Disney IP portfolio. I should search for \"4-D film attractions Walt Disney World\" and then check if any of them are based on a 2004 computer-animated Christmas movie, or if there's any link to \"The Polar Express.\""
