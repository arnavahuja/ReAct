As the mountain chain eroded in the Silurian and Devonian periods, sediment spread throughout the present-day Appalachians and midcontinental North America.[1]. Beginning in Cambrian time, about 550 Ma, the Iapetus Ocean began to close. The weight of accumulating sediments, in addition to compressional forces in the crust, forced the eastern edge of the North American continent to fold gradually downward.[2] In this manner, shallow-water carbonate deposition that had persisted on the continental shelf margin through late Cambrian into early Ordovician time, gave way to fine-grained clastic deposition and deeper water conditions during the middle Ordovician.",

The range, which played a role in the history of geological science, is separated from the Berkshires and Green Mountains to the east by a series of valleys, principally those of the Housatonic River, Battenkill River and Otter Creek. The Taconics' highest point is Mount Equinox in Vermont at 3,840 feet (1,170\u00a0m); among many other summits are Dorset Mountain, Mount Greylock and Mount Everett.[1][2][3]. Forests are predominately maple-beech-birch with some. spruce-fir at higher elevations, \"and oak and hickory common to the south and at lower elevations.\"[4] Parts of the  Taconics are in the New England-Acadian forests ecoregion.[5] Although mostly private property, the Taconics contain a half-dozen sizable state forests and parks, as well as many preserves of lesser acreage protected by land trusts.[6][7][8][9][10] Several hundred miles of trails are within these mountains, including parts of the Appalachian Trail..",

According to the 2020 United States census, there were 7,751 people in the city.[7]. Archaeological records indicate that native American tribes shared hunting grounds in the area, most notably the Kootenai, the Pend d'Oreilles, and the Bitterroot Salish.[8] The Kootenai lived in the area for more than 14,000 years, inhabiting the mountainous terrain west of the Continental Divide, and traveled east of the divide for occasional buffalo hunts.[9] Though trappers, traders, and waves of westward immigrants passed through the area during the second half of the century, it wasn't until 1883 that the first permanent settler, John Morton built a cabin on the shore of Whitefish Lake, just west of the mouth of the Whitefish River. Morton was joined by the local logging industry forefathers\u2014including the Baker and Hutchinson brothers\u2014in the early 1890s. Logging crews \"boomed-up\" their logs behind a dam built at the river mouth by the Boston & Montana Commercial Company, which, when opened, created a rush of water that helped float the logs down the river to Kalispell.[9].",

The first European settler to explore the Flathead Valley was likely surveyor Peter Fidler of the Hudson's Bay Company in the 18th century. From 1870, permanent settlement and the introduction of livestock brought permanent changes, as did the near-eradication of local bison populations.[7]. In 1884, a short-lived town called Ashley was founded where Kalispell is today. Three years later nearby Demersville was founded.",
