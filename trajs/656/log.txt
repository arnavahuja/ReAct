STEP: 6

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 6: I have identified Booger McFarland as a former defensive tackle (which includes nose tackle) who began contributing to ESPN's coverage in 2017. The provided text for Booger McFarland's 2017 role specifically mentions "ESPN's NFL coverage, including "Monday Night Countdown" and "NFL Primetime"". The question asks about "ESPN College Football Friday Primetime". There is a discrepancy between "NFL Primetime" and "College Football Friday Primetime". However, I have not found any other former nose tackle associated with ESPN and 2017. Given that Booger McFarland fits most of the criteria (former nose tackle, ESPN, 2017, announcer) and no other candidate is apparent from the searches, it is highly probable he is the intended answer, despite the slight mismatch in the specific type of "Primetime" show mentioned. It's possible the article simplifies his roles or the show names are similar enough.
