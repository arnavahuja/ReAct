Observation 2: Texas Highways is a monthly magazine put out by the Texas Department of Transportation that, according to the agency, "promotes travel and tourism to Texas through articles and photography."[1]. Texas Highways was founded in 1953 when the Texas Department of Transportation changed the name of its employee publication from Maintenance and Construction Bulletin. The magazine originally centered on highway design, construction, and maintenance, but in 1962, editor Frank Lively began adding stories about history and travel. The publication was originally an internal resource for the Texas Highway Department.[2]. On Livelyâ€™s recommendation, the magazine was converted to a travel publication offered to the general public in 1974 and by 1975 the Texas Legislature deemed Texas Highways as "This Official Travel Magazine of Texas." Lively retired in 1990, and retained an active relationship with the publication.[2] The first issue was dedicated entirely to Native Americans in Texas, despite the opposition from the director of the Travel and Information Division at the time, who claimed "...never to devote an entire issue to one subject."[2].
