        "The Glorious Revolution,[a] also known as the Revolution of 1688, was the deposition of James\u00a0II and VII in November 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary\u00a0II and her Dutch husband, William III of Orange (William III and II), a nephew of James who thereby had an interest to the throne irrespective of his marriage to his cousin Mary. The two ruled as joint monarchs of England, Scotland, and Ireland until Mary's death in 1694, when William became ruler in his own right. Jacobitism, the political movement that aimed to restore the exiled James or his descendants of the House of Stuart to the throne, persisted into the late 18th century. William's invasion was the last successful invasion of England.[1].",

        "James II and VII (14 October 1633 O.S. \u2013 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII from the death of his elder brother, Charles II, on 6 February 1685, until he was deposed in the 1688 Glorious Revolution. The last Catholic monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland, his reign is now remembered primarily for conflicts over religion. However, it also involved struggles over the principles of absolutism and divine right of kings, with his deposition ending a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of the English Parliament over the Crown.[4]. James was the second surviving son of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France, and was created Duke of York at birth.",
        "Jacobitism[c] was a political ideology advocating the restoration of the senior line of the House of Stuart to the British throne. When James II of England chose exile after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, the Parliament of England ruled he had \"abandoned\" the English throne, which was given to his Protestant daughter Mary II of England, and his nephew, her husband William III.[1] On the same basis, in April the Scottish Convention awarded Mary and William the throne of Scotland.[2]. The Revolution created the principle of a contract between monarch and people, which if violated meant the monarch could be removed. A key tenet of Jacobitism was that kings were appointed by God, making the post-1688 regime illegitimate. However, it also functioned as an outlet for popular discontent, and thus was a complex mix of ideas, many opposed by the Stuarts themselves.",

The Hells Angels are allied with numerous smaller motorcycle gangs \u2013 such as the Devils Diciples,[7] the Diablos,[7] El Forastero,[7] the Galloping Goose,[8] the Hessians,[1] the Iron Horsemen,[9] the Red Devils,[10] the Sons of Silence,[1] and the Warlocks[11] \u2013 and have associated in criminal ventures with the Buffalo,[1] Cleveland,[1] Gambino,[1] Genovese,[1] Los Angeles,[12] Patriarca,[13] and San Jose[12] crime families, as well as the Aryan Brotherhood,[14] the Mexican Mafia,[15] and the Nazi Lowriders.[16] Rival motorcycle gangs include the Bandidos,[17] the Breed,[18] the Mongols,[19] the Outlaws,[5] the Pagans,[5] the Sons of Satan,[20] and the Vagos.[21]. HAMC chapters were established in Anchorage and Fairbanks in December 1982 following a merger with the Brothers MC.[22] The Brothers were formed in 1967,[23] and established an association with the Hells Angels in California's San Francisco Bay Area by 1977.[24] The club \"patched over\" to the HAMC during a ceremony in California attended by members of the Brothers' Fairbanks chapter.[25] The Alaskan Hells Angels are involved in methamphetamine trafficking.[26].

Thompson called Barger \"the Maximum Leader\" of the Hells Angels,[6] and Philip Martin of the Phoenix New Times described him as \"the archetypical Hells Angel\", saying he \"didn't found the motorcycle club ... but he constructed the myth\".[7] Barger authored five books, and appeared on television and in film.. Barger served a total of 13 years in prison, following a conviction for heroin trafficking in 1974, and a 1988 conviction for conspiracy to bomb the clubhouse of a rival motorcycle club, the Outlaws.[8] He was also acquitted of murder in 1972, and of racketeering in 1980.[9] Barger rejected accusations from law enforcement characterizing the Hells Angels as an organized crime syndicate, and maintained that the club should not be held accountable for crimes committed by individual members.[1].",

Despite Ryan's bold prediction of the Bills making the playoffs at his introductory press conference, the Bills were unable to do so in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team\u2019s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball\u2019s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015.[1].
