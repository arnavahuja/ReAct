Observation 1: In diplomacy, a persona non grata (PNG)[a] is a foreign diplomat that is asked by the host country to be recalled to their home country. If the person is not recalled as requested, the host state may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the diplomatic mission (including the removal of diplomatic immunity). A host country may declare any member of a diplomatic staff persona non grata at any time without any explanation.. Under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a receiving state may "at any time and without having to explain its decision" declare any member of a diplomatic staff persona non grata.[1] A person so declared is considered unacceptable and is usually recalled to their home nation. If not recalled, the receiving state "may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the mission".[2] A person can be declared persona non grata before even entering the country.[1].

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 3: The initial search for "Persona Non Grata" returned the diplomatic term, not a specific work. The question implies "Persona Non Grata" is something that "includes interviews". I need to find what this "Persona Non Grata" is. It's likely a film or a book. I will try searching for "Persona Non Grata (film)" or "Persona Non Grata (book)". Given the context of interviews with a political leader, a film is more likely.
