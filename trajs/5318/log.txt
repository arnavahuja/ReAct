Observation 3: Whitefish (Salish: epɫx̣ʷy̓u, "has whitefish"[6]) is a city in Flathead County, Montana, United States. According to the 2020 United States census, there were 7,751 people in the city.[7]. Archaeological records indicate that native American tribes shared hunting grounds in the area, most notably the Kootenai, the Pend d'Oreilles, and the Bitterroot Salish.[8] The Kootenai lived in the area for more than 14,000 years, inhabiting the mountainous terrain west of the Continental Divide, and traveled east of the divide for occasional buffalo hunts.[9] Though trappers, traders, and waves of westward immigrants passed through the area during the second half of the century, it wasn't until 1883 that the first permanent settler, John Morton built a cabin on the shore of Whitefish Lake, just west of the mouth of the Whitefish River. Morton was joined by the local logging industry forefathers—including the Baker and Hutchinson brothers—in the early 1890s. Logging crews "boomed-up" their logs behind a dam built at the river mouth by the Boston & Montana Commercial Company, which, when opened, created a rush of water that helped float the logs down the river to Kalispell.[9].

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 5: I have found that KHNK is licensed to Whitefish, Montana. I also found that its base of operations is in Kalispell, Montana. The question asks "What town... is the KHNK radio station located in?". "Licensed to serve" implies location. However, the provided population (4,688 in 2010) did not match the 2020 population of Whitefish (7,751), and I couldn't find the 2010 population using `Lookup[2010]` on the Whitefish passage. Now I will search Kalispell, Montana to check its population, especially around 2010, to see if it matches the given population.

Observation 5: Kalispell (/ˈkæləˌspɛl, ˌkæləˈspɛl/,  Montana Salish: Ql̓ispé, Kutenai language: Kqayaqawakⱡuʔnam[4]) is a city in and the county seat of Flathead County, Montana, United States.[5] The 2020 census put Kalispell's population at 24,558.[6] Among cities in Montana, it is the 8th largest by area, 7th most populous, and 8th fastest growing from 2010 to 2020.[6] In Montana's northwest region, it is the largest city and the commercial center of the Kalispell Micropolitan Statistical Area.[3] The name Kalispell is a Salish word meaning "flat land above the lake".. The first European settler to explore the Flathead Valley was likely surveyor Peter Fidler of the Hudson's Bay Company in the 18th century. From 1870, permanent settlement and the introduction of livestock brought permanent changes, as did the near-eradication of local bison populations.[7]. In 1884, a short-lived town called Ashley was founded where Kalispell is today. Three years later nearby Demersville was founded.
