STEP: 1

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 1: Let me do the action Search[strongest recorded tropical cyclone]
Action 1: Search[strongest recorded tropical cyclone]
Observation 1: Could not find strongest recorded tropical cyclone. Similar: ['List of the most intense tropical cyclones', 'Tropical cyclones in 2025', 'List of Atlantic hurricane records', 'List of tropical cyclone records', 'Atlantic hurricane (redirect from Atlantic tropical cyclone)'].

SIMULATION TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 1: Let me do the action Search[strongest recorded tropical cyclone]
Action 1: Search[strongest recorded tropical cyclone]
Observation 1: **Strongest Recorded Tropical Cyclones**. The strength of a tropical cyclone is primarily measured by two key meteorological parameters: its **minimum central atmospheric pressure** and its **maximum sustained wind speed**. While these two metrics often correlate, they do not always identify the same storm as the "strongest" depending on the specific criteria used.. ### By Minimum Central Pressure: Super Typhoon Tip (1979). **Super Typhoon Tip**, which formed in the western Pacific Ocean in October 1979, holds the undisputed record for the **lowest central atmospheric pressure** ever recorded in a tropical cyclone.



STEP: 2

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 2: Let me do the action Search[List of the most intense tropical cyclones]
Action 2: Search[List of the most intense tropical cyclones]
Observation 2: This is a list of the most intense tropical cyclones as measured by minimum atmospheric pressure at sea level. Although maximum sustained winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds, variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damage, and tornadoes can vary significantly in storms with similar wind speeds. The minimum central pressure at sea level is often used to compare tropical cyclones because the measurements are easier and use consistent methodology worldwide, in contrast to difficult-to-estimate maximum sustained winds whose measurement methods vary widely. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth.

Observation 2: A list of the most intense tropical cyclones typically ranks these powerful weather systems based on two primary metrics: **minimum central atmospheric pressure** and **maximum sustained winds**. While these two factors are often correlated, they don't always yield the same ranking, and the precise measurement can vary depending on the observing agency and methodology.. ### Measurement of Intensity. *   **Minimum Central Pressure (MCP):** Often considered the most reliable indicator of a tropical cyclone's overall strength and extent. Lower pressure indicates a more intense storm.

Observation 3: A list of the most intense tropical cyclones typically ranks these powerful weather systems based on two primary metrics: **minimum central atmospheric pressure** and **maximum sustained winds**. While these two factors are often correlated, they don't always yield the same ranking, and the precise measurement can vary depending on the observing agency and methodology.. ### Measurement of Intensity. *   **Minimum Central Pressure (MCP):** Often considered the most reliable indicator of a tropical cyclone's overall strength and extent.

 Thought 4: Let me do the action Lookup[lowest pressure]
Action 4: Lookup[lowest pressure]
Observation 4: A tropical cyclone record refers to an extreme measurement or event associated with a tropical cyclone, such as the lowest central pressure, highest sustained winds, largest size, longest duration, or most significant rainfall accumulation. These records are compiled from historical data, observations, and reanalysis efforts by various meteorological agencies worldwide. Due to differences in measurement techniques, observational capabilities, and definitions across different ocean basins and time periods, some records may have caveats or be subject to re-evaluation..

STEP: 6

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 6: My previous searches for lists of intense cyclones didn't directly provide the name of the strongest one. The prompt asks for "the strongest recorded tropical cyclone". I need to find the specific name of this cyclone. I will try a more direct search for this specific record.
Action 6: Search[strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded]
Observation 6: Could not find strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded. Similar: ['List of the most intense tropical cyclones', 'Tropical cyclones in 2025', 'Hurricane Patricia (redirect from Cyclone Patricia)', 'List of Atlantic hurricane records', 'South Pacific tropical cyclone'].

SIMULATION TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 6: Let me do the action Lookup[lowest central pressure]
Action 6: Lookup[lowest central pressure]
Observation 6: The term "strongest tropical cyclone" can be interpreted in several ways, most commonly referring to the lowest central atmospheric pressure, highest sustained winds, or largest physical size. Based on the widely accepted metric of minimum central pressure, **Typhoon Tip** of 1979 holds the record for the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded.. ### Typhoon Tip (1979). *   **Lowest Central Pressure:** Typhoon Tip reached an estimated minimum central pressure of **870 hPa (25.69 inHg)** at 06:00 UTC on October 12, 1979. This measurement was taken by dropsonde from a reconnaissance aircraft, making it one of the most reliably recorded pressure readings for a tropical cyclone..

Observation 7: A "List of the most intense tropical cyclones" compiles tropical cyclones (which include hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones depending on the basin) based on their peak intensity, typically measured by two primary metrics: minimum central atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained wind speeds.. ### Measures of Intensity. *   **Minimum Central Pressure (mbar/hPa):** This is generally considered the most reliable indicator of a tropical cyclone's true intensity. Lower pressure indicates a more powerful storm, as it reflects a stronger pressure gradient and a more intense circulation. Direct measurements often come from reconnaissance aircraft (e.g., Hurricane Hunters in the Atlantic), while satellite-based estimates (e.g., Dvorak technique) are used globally..
