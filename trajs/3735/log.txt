Observation 2: The 2015 season was the Buffalo Bills' 46th in the National Football League (NFL), their 56th overall, their third under the leadership of general manager Doug Whaley and their first under head coach Rex Ryan. It was also their first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (who also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson that March at the age of 95.. The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.. Despite Ryan's bold prediction of the Bills making the playoffs at his introductory press conference, the Bills were unable to do so in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team’s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015.[1]. The Bills made headlines when they hired a new head coach in Rex Ryan, who signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract on January 12, 2015 after having previously spent the past six seasons coaching the division-rival New York Jets.

Observation 2: The 2015 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise's 56th season in the National Football League, their 46th in Ralph Wilson Stadium, and their first under head coach Rex Ryan. The team finished the season with an 8–8 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the 16th consecutive season.. **Season summary**. Following an unexpected 9–7 campaign in 2014 under Doug Marrone, who resigned shortly after the season, the Bills hired former New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan to lead the team. Ryan's hiring brought high expectations, especially with the addition of high-profile players like running back LeSean McCoy (acquired via trade from the Philadelphia Eagles) and wide receiver Percy Harvin (signed as a free agent)..
