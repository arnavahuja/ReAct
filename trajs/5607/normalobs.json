Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists.

        "Jack Tripper is a fictional character on the sitcom Three's Company, which is based upon the character Robin Tripp from Man About the House created by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. Jack was played by the actor John Ritter.[1][2][3]. Janet, another character in the show, reasoned with the landlord, Stanley Roper who lived downstairs and he agreed that Jack could stay because Janet told Mr. Roper that Jack was gay, without Jack's knowledge. Jack was, however, actually straight (the comedy stemming from having to \"play gay\" provided much of the story for the sitcom).[4] Jack is something of a ladies' man, but is also kind-hearted, loyal, and protective of the women he lives with.[5].",
