STEP: 4

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 4: Kamal Haasan has four National Film Awards, and films he was in were submitted for Academy Awards (which can be interpreted as a form of nomination related to him, even if not a personal acting nomination). The Filmfare awards count (2 regular, 18 South) doesn't perfectly match "eight Filmfare Awards," but it's close enough given the other criteria matching. I will assume Kamal Haasan is the described actor. Now I need to find the debut film of an actor who also starred in Kamal Haasan's debut film. First, I need to identify Kamal Haasan's debut film. The observation says "he received the President's Gold Medal at the age of six for acting in his debut film Kalathur Kannamma." So, Kamal Haasan's debut film is "Kalathur Kannamma". Now I need to search for "Kalathur Kannamma" to see other actors who starred in it.
Action 4: Search[Kalathur Kannamma]
Observation 4: Kalathur Kannamma is a 1960 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by A. Bhimsingh and written by Javar Seetharaman. The film stars Gemini Ganesh, Savitri Ganesh and Kamal Haasan. It revolves around a couple — a wealthy zamindar's son and a farmer's daughter — who are separated due to circumstances, while their innocent son is forced to grow up in an orphanage.. Kalathur Kannamma, inspired by the 1960 Chinese film Nobody's Child, was originally directed by T.

STEP: 5

NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 5: I have identified Kamal Haasan as the actor with four National Film Awards, Filmfare Awards, and Academy Award nominations (via film submissions). His debut film is "Kalathur Kannamma." The question asks for an actor whose *debut film* also starred Kamal Haasan. Since "Kalathur Kannamma" stars Gemini Ganesh and Savitri Ganesh alongside Kamal Haasan, I need to check if "Kalathur Kannamma" was the debut film for either Gemini Ganesh or Savitri Ganesh.
Action 5: Search[Gemini Ganesan debut film]
Observation 5: Could not find Gemini Ganesan debut film. Similar: ['Gemini Ganesan', 'Gemini (2002 film)', 'List of Tamil film actors', 'Gemini Ganeshanum Suruli Raajanum', 'Sivaji Ganesan'].
