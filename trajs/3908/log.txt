NORMAL TRAJECTORY:
 Thought 7: I have searched for the stadium and identified the sponsor as Coopers Brewery. I have then searched for Coopers Brewery, but the initial paragraph does not contain sales data for 2013. I tried more specific searches like "Coopers Brewery sales 2013" and "Coopers Brewery financial results" which did not yield results. This specific sales figure for a particular year might not be directly in the first paragraph of any single Wikipedia article that an exact search can pull up, or it might be in a section of the "Coopers Brewery" article that is not retrieved by the initial "Search" action. However, I must find the answer using the provided tools. I will try a more general search related to beer in Australia, hoping to find a page that summarizes brewery production.
