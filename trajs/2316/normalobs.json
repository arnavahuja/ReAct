    "prompt": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

        "The Calabrian black squirrel (Sciurus meridionalis) is a species of tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus, endemic to the forests of the regions of Calabria and Basilicata, in the south of the Italian Peninsula.. It has long been considered a subspecies of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), but studies published in 2009\u20132017 revealed that it is unique in both genetics and appearance, leading to its recognition as a distinct species.[1][2]. The Calabrian black squirrel is an arboreal animal that generally resembles the red squirrel in its behavior. Unlike the highly variable red squirrel, the Calabrian black squirrel is monomorphic (not variable in appearance), being very dark brown to blackish with contrasting white underparts. Compared to red squirrels of northern Italy, the Calabrian black squirrel is also significantly larger, weighing 280\u2013530\u00a0g (10\u201318.5\u00a0oz) or on average about 35% more.[2].",

The Italian peninsula (Italian: penisola italica or penisola italiana),  is a peninsula within the Italian geographical region, extending from the southern Alps in the north to the central Mediterranean Sea in the south which comprises much of the country of Italy and the enclaved microstates of San Marino and Vatican City.. The peninsula is also known as the Italic Peninsula, Apennine Peninsula, Italian Boot, or Mainland Italy.. It is nicknamed lo Stivale (\"the Boot\"), because the shape of the peninsula resembles a high-heeled boot. Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (\"the Toe\"), Salento (\"the Heel\") and Gargano (\"the Spur\").[1] The backbone of the Italian peninsula consists of the Apennine Mountains, from which it takes one of its names.",

        "In diplomacy, a persona non grata (PNG)[a] is a foreign diplomat that is asked by the host country to be recalled to their home country. If the person is not recalled as requested, the host state may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the diplomatic mission (including the removal of diplomatic immunity). A host country may declare any member of a diplomatic staff persona non grata at any time without any explanation.. Under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a receiving state may \"at any time and without having to explain its decision\" declare any member of a diplomatic staff persona non grata.[1] A person so declared is considered unacceptable and is usually recalled to their home nation. If not recalled, the receiving state \"may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the mission\".[2] A person can be declared persona non grata before even entering the country.[1].",

        "A hot toddy, also known as hot whiskey in Ireland,[1][2] and occasionally called southern cough syrup[3] within the Southern United States, is typically a mixed drink made of liquor and water with honey (or in some recipes, sugar), lemon, and spices, and served hot.[4]  Recipes vary, and hot toddy is traditionally drunk as a nightcap before retiring for the night, in wet or cold weather,  or to relieve the symptoms of the cold and flu. In How to Drink, Victoria Moore describes the drink as \"the vitamin C for health, the honey to soothe, the alcohol to numb.\"[5][6]. A hot toddy is a mixture of a spirit (usually whisky), hot water, and honey (or, in some recipes, sugar). In Canada, maple syrup may be used. Additional ingredients such as cloves, a lemon slice or cinnamon (in stick or ground form) are often also added.[7][8].",
