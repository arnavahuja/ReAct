    "prompt": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains.

Eric's Trip achieved prominence as the first Canadian band to be signed to Seattle's flagship grunge label Sub Pop in the early 1990s.[2]. The band had a minor hit in alternative circles with the single \"View Master\", from the 1994 album Forever Again.. Eric's Trip formed in 1990 when musicians Rick White and Chris Thompson joined Julie Doiron and Ed Vaughan (who was later replaced by Mark Gaudet). They took their name from a Sonic Youth song[3] and developed a unique sound which fused elements of the distorted guitar of Dinosaur Jr., vocal elements of My Bloody Valentine, the folk leanings of Neil Young, and the lo-fi aesthetic of Sebadoh.",
        "Jan Axel Blomberg (born 2 August 1969), better known by his stage name Hellhammer,[1] is a Norwegian drummer known for his role as the drummer of the black metal band Mayhem, which he joined in 1988. He is the only member to have appeared on all of their albums. In 1987, Blomberg, alongside Steinar Sverd Johnsen and Marius Vold, formed the avant-garde black metal band Arcturus (initially under the name Mortem), which disbanded in April 2007 and reunited in 2011.[2] He adopted his stage name in homage to the Swiss extreme metal band Hellhammer.[3] Acclaimed as a talented musician,[4] Blomberg is a three-time recipient of the Spellemannprisen award.[5]. As a child, Blomberg's primary interests were football and wrestling. Initially, he had no interest in drums or drumming; however, as music became increasingly appealing to him, he began to find different instruments intriguing, which eventually led to an interest in drums.[citation needed] His grandparents purchased his first three drum kits, the first of which was a four-piece jazz kit.",
