The Park is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player, Lorraine, interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. The game does not feature combat or enemies, and Lorraine can only interact with limited objects, mainly notes that reveal the backstory of the park. Lorraine can call out to character Callum and follow his voice to reach areas or objectives within the park, such as the rides. There are seven different rides to experience, including a dark ride and a roller coaster.[7]  The rides further the story, and provide scares.",
